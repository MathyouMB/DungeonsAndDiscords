# 🐉 Dungeons And Discords
Dungeons and Discords is a turn based game playable in any discord server. The project currently has a basic turn based system, and will later implement an action point system similar to dungeons and dragons. The project is built using a Ruby on Rails GraphQL API and Typescript using the Discord.js library.
